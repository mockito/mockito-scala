  /**
   * Sets the real implementation to be called when the method is called on a mock object.
   * <p>
   * As usual you are going to read <b>the partial mock warning</b>:
   * Object oriented programming is more less tackling complexity by dividing the complexity into separate, specific, SRPy objects.
   * How does partial mock fit into this paradigm? Well, it just doesn't...
   * Partial mock usually means that the complexity has been moved to a different method on the same object.
   * In most cases, this is not the way you want to design your application.
   * <p>
   * However, there are rare cases when partial mocks come handy:
   * dealing with code you cannot change easily (3rd party interfaces, interim refactoring of legacy code etc.)
   * However, I wouldn't use partial mocks for new, test-driven & well-designed code.
   * <pre class="code"><code class="java">
   *   // someMethod() must be safe (e.g. doesn't throw, doesn't have dependencies to the object state, etc.)
   *   // if it isn't safe then you will have trouble stubbing it using this api. Use Mockito.doCallRealMethod() instead.
   *   when(mock.someMethod()).thenCallRealMethod();
   *
   *   // calls real method:
   *   mock.someMethod();
   *
   * </code></pre>
   * See also javadoc {@link Mockito#spy(Object)} to find out more about partial mocks.
   * <b>Mockito.spy() is a recommended way of creating partial mocks.</b>
   * The reason is it guarantees real methods are called against correctly constructed object because you're responsible for constructing the object passed to spy() method.
   * <p>
   * See examples in javadoc for {@link Mockito#when}
